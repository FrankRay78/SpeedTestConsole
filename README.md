## About The Project
A cross-platform command-line application for performing network speed tests, including server discovery, latency measurement, and download speed testing. 

SpeedTestConsole is not endorsed by or related to [Speedtest by Ookla](https://www.speedtest.net/) in any way, although their servers are used under the hood.

<br />


## Getting Started
I use Windows 10, Visual Studio 2022 Community, and Microsoft .Net 8.0 to develop and build the codebase - you will need the same, or similar.

Then clone this repository locally and build.

<br />


## Usage
`SpeedTestConsole --help` will display detailed usage instructions.
